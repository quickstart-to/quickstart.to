## TL;DR

**One-liner**: Cooking is just applying heat to food - master a few techniques and you can make almost anything.

**Why it matters**:
- Save money - eating out costs 3-5x more
- Eat healthier - control what goes into your food
- Impress others - everyone loves a home-cooked meal
- Creative outlet - experiment and make it your own

## Fundamentals

### Heat Levels

- **Low heat**: Simmering, melting butter, slow cooking
- **Medium heat**: Most cooking - eggs, vegetables, sauces
- **High heat**: Searing meat, boiling water, stir-frying

### The 5 Basic Techniques

1. **Sautéing**: Quick cooking in a little oil over high heat
2. **Roasting**: Dry heat in oven, great for vegetables and meat
3. **Boiling**: Cook in hot water - pasta, eggs, vegetables
4. **Pan-frying**: More oil than sautéing, lower heat
5. **Steaming**: Gentle cooking, preserves nutrients

### Essential Ratios

- **Pasta water**: 4 quarts water + 1 tbsp salt per pound
- **Rice**: 1 cup rice + 2 cups water
- **Vinaigrette**: 3 parts oil + 1 part acid (vinegar/lemon)

## Getting Started

### What You Need

**Basic equipment**:
- One good pan (10-12 inch)
- One pot
- Sharp knife
- Cutting board
- Spatula

**Pantry essentials**:
- Oil (olive or vegetable)
- Salt and pepper
- Garlic and onions
- Butter

### Your First Dish: Pan-Fried Egg

1. Heat pan over medium heat (2 minutes)
2. Add a pat of butter
3. When butter foams, crack egg into pan
4. Season with salt and pepper
5. Cook until white is set (3 minutes)
6. Slide onto plate

## Common Mistakes

### Food sticking to pan

**Problem**: Pan wasn't hot enough

**Fix**: Preheat properly. Add oil, wait until it shimmers (moves easily when you tilt the pan).

### Vegetables are soggy

**Problem**: Pan was overcrowded

**Fix**: Cook in batches. Food releases water, too much food = steaming instead of browning.

### Burned outside, raw inside

**Problem**: Heat too high

**Fix**: Lower heat and cook longer. For thick items, use oven to finish.

### Bland food

**Problem**: Under-seasoned

**Fix**: Salt in layers as you cook, not just at the end. Taste as you go.
