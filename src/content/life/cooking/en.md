## TL;DR

**What**: Essential cooking techniques everyone should know.

**Why**: Save money, eat healthier, impress your friends.

## Quick Start

**Prepare**:
- Pan or pot
- Spatula, knife
- Oil, salt, pepper

**Steps**:
1. Heat pan over medium heat
2. Add a bit of oil
3. Add food when oil shimmers
4. Season while cooking
5. Don't flip too often

## Cheatsheet

- **Low heat**: Simmering, melting butter, slow cooking
- **Medium heat**: Most cooking - eggs, vegetables, sauces
- **High heat**: Searing meat, boiling water, stir-frying
- **Oil shimmers**: Ready to cook
- **Meat sizzles**: Don't flip yet, wait for release

## Gotchas

### Food sticking to pan

Pan wasn't hot enough. Preheat properly, oil should shimmer.

### Vegetables are soggy

Pan was overcrowded. Cook in batches.

### Burned outside, raw inside

Heat too high. Lower heat and cook longer.
